# Technical Documentation for Eligibility Engine and API

## Product Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of the Eligibility Engine and API is to automate the process
of determining the eligibility status of healthcare providers by
evaluating their federal and state monitoring statuses and credential
information. The engine will streamline verification processes,
improving speed and accuracy for healthcare organizations.

### Target Audience

The key user personas include:

- **Healthcare Providers**: Require up-to-date eligibility status for
  billing and compliance.

- **HR Professionals**: Need to verify credentials for hiring and
  maintaining staff records.

- **Credentialing Departments**: Focus on efficiently managing and
  updating provider credentials and compliance records.

### Expected Outcomes

- **Tangible Benefits**: Reduce manual verification workload, increase
  data accuracy, and accelerate eligibility assessments.

- **Intangible Benefits**: Improve compliance processes, enhance
  provider experience, and increase organizational trust.

- **Key Metrics**: Time to verify eligibility, reduction in verification
  errors, and improved compliance rates.

## Design Details

### Architectural Overview

The Eligibility Engine will consist of several key components, including
the data processing module, rules engine, and API layers. A high-level
architecture diagram is necessary to illustrate these interactions.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Data Structures**: Utilize structured databases to manage provider
  profiles, credential statuses, and monitoring data.

- **Algorithms**: Implement rules-based logic to determine eligibility
  status based on predefined criteria. Optimize for scalability and
  real-time processing.

### System Interfaces

- **API Endpoints**:

  - /profiles/search: Retrieve provider profiles.

  - /eligibility/check: Check provider eligibility status.

- **Protocols**: RESTful API standards.

- **Third-Party Services**: Integration with federal and state databases
  for credential verification.

### User Interfaces

Currently, focus is on backend services. Future developments may include
a web interface for user interaction and management of eligibility
checks.

## Testing Plan

### Test Strategies

- **Unit Testing**: Validate individual components of the eligibility
  engine.

- **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless operation between API
  endpoints and data sources.

- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulate real-world usage scenarios to verify
  overall system performance.

### Testing Tools

- **Automation Tools**: Use tools like JUnit and Postman for API testing
  and Selenium for integration and E2E testing.

### Testing Environments

- **Development**: Local environment setup aligned with production
  configurations.

- **Staging**: Mirror production for final validation before release.

### Test Cases

Key scenarios include API response validation, rule execution accuracy,
and handling of edge cases like incomplete or corrupt data.

## Deployment Plan

### Deployment Environment

- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-based, ensuring scalability and high
  availability, e.g., AWS or Azure.

- **Configuration**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly configured
  and managed.

### Deployment Tools

- **CI/CD Tools**: Employ Jenkins or GitLab CI for automated deployment
  pipelines.

- **Containers**: Utilize Docker for consistent environment management.

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Build and Test**: Execute automated tests.

2.  **Release Candidate**: Deploy to staging for further validation.

3.  **Production Rollout**: Gradually deploy updates, monitor health
    metrics.

### Post-Deployment Verification

- **Monitoring**: Set up real-time monitoring and logging.

- **Validation**: Perform checks on key functionalities and system
  interfaces.

### Continuous Deployment

Implement CI/CD pipelines to streamline updates and patches, minimizing
system downtime and manual intervention.
